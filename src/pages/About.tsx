            Dufie's was born from my personal struggle with sensitive skin and the frustration of not finding products 
            that were both effective and gentle. After years of research into traditional botanical remedies and modern 
            cosmetic science, I created formulations that transformed my skin â€“ and I knew I had to share them with the world.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-8">
            Today, our team combines ancestral wisdom with scientific innovation to create products that respect your skin's 
            natural processes while delivering visible results. Every bottle represents our commitment to your skin health 
            and our planet's wellbeing.
